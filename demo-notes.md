   - "Summarize all the events from the past week"
   - "What specialists has the patient seen recently?"
   - "Are there any medication changes I should be aware of?"

3. **Click Source Pills**: Show how answers are grounded in actual records by clicking the source citations.

4. **Multiple Notes**: Ingest 2-3 notes in sequence to demonstrate how the AI can connect information across multiple clinical documents.
